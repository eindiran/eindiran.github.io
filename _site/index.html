<p>My name is Elliott Indiran and I am a software engineer and computational linguist in San Francisco. This site includes a smattering of things that I have made or find interesting, various projects I’ve worked on, and some posts I’ve made.</p>

<p>The principle goal of this site is to construct a single place someone can go and see the projects, the writing, etc. easily and together. Beyond that starting point, I am going to play it by year and see where this goes/how it turns out.</p>

<p>Right now I am participating in a challenge with myself, where I have to read a specified number of books before January 1st, 2019. That will be a trove of potential things to write about, I ~think~, but I’ll need to wait until the year is out. Hopefully I will get a chance to try my hand at writing here before then.</p>

<h3 id="site-map">Site Map</h3>
<hr />

<p>First up, here are the various areas of the main site:</p>

<p><a href="/about">About Me</a> – A little bit about me as a person, including my education, work history, and some of my interests.</p>

<p><a href="/projects">My Projects</a> – A list of projects I have started in the last few years and open source projects that I have contributed to. I have included links to all projects, so if you spot something interesting, you can try playing around with it.</p>

<p><a href="/posts">Blog Posts</a> – Blog posts I’ve written; there aren’t a ton yet. Hopefully I will use 2019 as a chance to try writing more often, as I do enjoy it. If you click here, you will be able to see a list of posts that are currently released.</p>

<p><a href="/contact">Contact Me</a> – Use this page to find a suitable way to reach out to me.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="around-the-web">Around the Web</h3>
<hr />

<p>Below are a few of my other accounts from around the internet. You can often find me in <code class="highlighter-rouge">#lobsters</code> channel on irc, under the username <code class="highlighter-rouge">eindiran</code>. If you want to speak to me directly, by far the best method is email. See the <a href="/contact">Contact</a> page for additional details.</p>

<p>The following three links cover my professional accounts; they host my work experience and my portfolio:</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://github.com/eindiran">GitHub</a> – This has been in active use for about 5 years, so there is fair amount of stuff jammed inside.
    * Feel free to open PRs on anything I’ve worked on and let me know if you have any questions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eindiran/">LinkedIn</a> – This is my LinkedIn profile, but it hasn’t been updated in a while. A lot of my early work experience has since been cycled off my résumé due to space constraints, but it is recorded here in significant depth, so LinkedIn can provide a much fuller picture of my earlier work history.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/eindiran/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf">Résumé</a> – A fairly recent copy of my résumé, not tailored to any specific job.
    * The link points to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code> version, but if you want the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.tex</code> document in its raw form, it’s also in the same repository.
    * From the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tex</code>, you can likely tell that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdf</code> version doesn’t include some sections for brevity.</p>

<h3 id="other-accounts">Other Accounts</h3>

<p>These are a few other sites that I use (at least somewhat) frequently. Aside from my Bandcamp collection, there probably isn’t a ton to see between these:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eindiran">Hacker News</a> – My HN account. I am sometimes more active on HN than I would like to admit.</li>
  <li><a href="https://lobste.rs">Lobsters</a> – I spend a fair amount of time in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">#lobsters</code> channel on irc (connect to <code class="highlighter-rouge">chat.freenode.net:6667</code> -&gt; join <code class="highlighter-rouge">#lobsters</code>. Come check it out!</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Eindiran">Wikipedia</a> – My Wikipedia account. I’m not usually a super active editor, but I do try to cleanup things whenever I can. Consider contributing by editing or donating to Wikipedia today!</li>
  <li><a href="https://bandcamp.com/eindiran">Bandcamp</a> – This is my Bandcamp page, specifically my ‘collection’ of music. The majority of music I listen to I buy (instead of streaming it), and Bandcamp is where I usually buy it. Check out my collection and maybe you’ll find something interesting.
    <ul>
      <li>Today I’ve been listening to some shoegaze (‘<a href="https://lsdandthesearchforgod.bandcamp.com/album/lsd-and-the-search-for-god">LSD and the Search for God</a>’), some death metal (‘<a href="https://listen.20buckspin.com/album/cosmovore">Cosmovore by Ulthar</a>’) and some electronic (‘<a href="https://shigeto.bandcamp.com/album/lineage">Lineage - Shigeto</a>’).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
