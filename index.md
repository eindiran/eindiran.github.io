### Introduction
<hr/>

<img style="float: left;" src="/assets/images/eindiran_mugshot.jpg" alt="drawing" width="220" Hspace="30" Vspace="10" title="Hiking in Portola Valley."/>

My name is Elliott Indiran and I am a software engineer and computational linguist in San Francisco. This site includes a smattering of things that I have made or find interesting, various projects I've worked on, and some posts I've made.

The principle goal of this site is to construct a single place someone can go and see the projects, the writing, etc. easily and together. Beyond that starting point, I am going to play it by year and see where this goes/how it turns out.

Right now I am participating in a challenge with myself, where I have to read a specified number of books before January 1st, 2019. That will be a trove of potential things to write about, I ~think~, but I'll need to wait until the year is out. Hopefully I will get a chance to try my hand at writing here before then.

### Site Map
<hr/>

First up, here are the various areas of the main site:

[About Me](/about) -- A little bit about me as a person, including my education, work history, and some of my interests.

[My Projects](/projects) -- A list of projects I have started in the last few years and open source projects that I have contributed to. I have included links to all projects, so if you spot something interesting, you can try playing around with it.

[Blog Posts](/posts) -- Blog posts I've written; there aren't a ton yet. Hopefully I will use 2019 as a chance to try writing more often, as I do enjoy it. If you click here, you will be able to see a list of posts that are currently released.

[Contact Me](/contact) -- Use this page to find a suitable way to reach out to me.

### Around the Web
<hr/>

Below are a few of my other accounts from around the internet. You can often find me in `#lobsters` channel on irc, under the username `eindiran`. If you want to speak to me directly, by far the best method is email. See the [Contact](/contact) page for additional details.

The following three links cover my professional accounts; they host my work experience and my portfolio:

<hr/>

[GitHub](https://github.com/eindiran) -- This has been in active use for about 5 years, so there is fair amount of stuff jammed inside.
    * Feel free to open PRs on anything I've worked on and let me know if you have any questions.

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eindiran/) -- This is my LinkedIn profile, but it hasn't been updated in a while. A lot of my early work experience has since been cycled off my résumé due to space constraints, but it is recorded here in significant depth, so LinkedIn can provide a much fuller picture of my earlier work history.

[Résumé](https://github.com/eindiran/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf) -- A fairly recent copy of my résumé, not tailored to any specific job.
    * The link points to the `.pdf` version, but if you want the `.tex` document in its raw form, it's also in the same repository.
    * From the `tex`, you can likely tell that the `pdf` version doesn't include some sections for brevity.

### Other Accounts
<hr/>

These are a few other sites that I use (at least somewhat) frequently. Aside from my Bandcamp collection, there probably isn't a ton to see between these:

* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eindiran) -- My HN account. I am sometimes more active on HN than I would like to admit.
* [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs) -- I spend a fair amount of time in the `#lobsters` channel on irc (connect to `chat.freenode.net:6667` -> join `#lobsters`. Come check it out!
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Eindiran) -- My Wikipedia account. I'm not usually a super active editor, but I do try to cleanup things whenever I can. Consider contributing by editing or donating to Wikipedia today!
* [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/eindiran) -- This is my Bandcamp page, specifically my 'collection' of music. The majority of music I listen to I buy (instead of streaming it), and Bandcamp is where I usually buy it. Check out my collection and maybe you'll find something interesting.
    * Today I've been listening to some shoegaze ('[LSD and the Search for God](https://lsdandthesearchforgod.bandcamp.com/album/lsd-and-the-search-for-god)'), some death metal ('[Cosmovore by Ulthar](https://listen.20buckspin.com/album/cosmovore)') and some electronic ('[Lineage - Shigeto](https://shigeto.bandcamp.com/album/lineage)').
