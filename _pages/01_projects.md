* [Urbane](https://github.com/eindiran/urbane) -- A [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter written in C.
* [dotfiles](https://github.com/eindiran/dotfiles) -- The dotfiles, shell scripts, and extensions necessary to set up a fully functional system + an installation script.

#### Sitrus:

* The [Sitrus](https://www.sitrus.io) mood-tracking app, available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.sitrus.moodSwipes) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sitrus/id1454172167).
* I helped write the Django + MongoDB backend that ran the [first](https://github.com/courageousillumination/paragon) and [second](https://github.com/courageousillumination/paragon-server) iterations of Sitrus: the site was a [quantified self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self) data platform, that allowed users to plug in a number of integrations and pull their QS data out of other sites and apps. The project's goal was to improve the usefulness of quantified self data by unlocking insights that would be otherwise inaccessible (when the data is siloed away) and to make QS accessible to everyone.
    * Sitrus was part of the 2018 class of Y Combinator's [Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org/). See our company profile [here](https://www.startupschool.org/companies/W9yQyJQrNgjU5Q).
