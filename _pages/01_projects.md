### My Projects
<hr/>

* Paragon Server -- I helped write the Django + MongoDB backend that runs the [Sitrus](https://www.sitrus.io) site. Sitrus is a [quantified self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self) data platform. It allows users to plug in a number of integrations and pull their QS data out of other sites and apps. Our goal is to improve the usefulness of user data by unlocking insights that would be otherwise inaccessible and to make QS accessible to everyone.
    * Sitrus was part of the 2018 class of Y Combinator's [Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org/). See our company profile [here](https://www.startupschool.org/companies/W9yQyJQrNgjU5Q).
* [AutoWater](https://github.com/eindiran/AutoWater) -- An automated watering system for potted plants built using an Arduino Uno. Documentation available [here](https://eindiran.github.io/AutoWater/).
* [AutoFeeder](https://github.com/eindiran/AutoFeeder) -- An automated fish feeder built using an Arduino Uno. Documentation available [here](https://eindiran.github.io/AutoFeeder/).
* [orgmode-to-anki](https://github.com/eindiran/orgmode-to-anki) -- A tool for automatically generating Anki flashcards from an orgmode-formatted file.
* [python-knitout](https://github.com/eindiran/python-knitout) -- A Python package that provides a thin interface over Knitout. For more information on Knitout, see the spec [here](https://textiles-lab.github.io/knitout/knitout.html) and a more relaxed talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEaK68VRAng).
* [jenkins-disk-usage](https://github.com/eindiran/jenkins-disk-usage) -- A Jenkins job for checking disk usage of a Jenkins build machine.
* [Mancala](https://github.com/eindiran/mancala) -- Play [Mancala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala) in the terminal; either multiplayer or against the computer.
