Hi, my name is Elliott Indiran. I work as a software engineer and computational linguist in the San Francisco Bay Area; since 2015 I've been working for [Promptu](http://promptu.com), a small voice recognition company based out of Menlo Park.

I'm a big fan of free and open-source software, particularly software licensed using [permissive licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license); many of my projects are available under the [MIT license](https://mit-license.org/). I have also contributed to a few open-source projects, most notably [Coconut](http://coconut-lang.org/), a functional language which compiles to Python.

Prior to coming to the Bay Area in 2015, I studied linguistics at the University of Chicago (BA'2015, Linguistics). My main academic interests surround the intersection of natural language and computer science.

#### Sitrus

I am interested in the quantified self movement and discovering ways of using data to improve my life.
In 2016, some friends and I cofounded [Sitrus](https://sitrus.io), a platform for managing and analyzing quantified self data.
Our current project is developing a light-weight, privacy-focused app for mood tracking and journaling, which is now available for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/sitrus-moods/id1454172167) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.sitrus.moodSwipes&hl=en_US).

#### About this site
<hr/>

 I started this blog in 2019, as a way to collect and flesh-out my thoughts. It is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), using a modified version of the [Jekyll Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
 The [name of the blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_British_terms_not_widely_used_in_the_United_States#F) comes from "faff", British slang for trivial or pointless messing around.
