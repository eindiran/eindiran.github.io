I am a computational linguist and software engineer, living in San Francisco.
I currently work on speech recognition at [Promptu Systems](http://www.promptu.com/). Additionally, I cofounded [Sitrus](https://sitrus.io), a platform for managing and analyzing quantified self data.

I'm a big fan of open-source software, particularly [permissive licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_licence), so many of my projects are open-source under the [MIT license](https://mit-license.org/). I have also contributed to a number of existing open-source projects, which you can find on the Projects page.


I write most of my hobby projects in Python, but I have experience writing in a number of languages including C, Java, Javascript, Nim, Groovy, and Coconut.
I also do a fair bit of automation using Jenkins + Python and Shell scripting.

Prior to coming to the Bay Area in 2015, I studied linguistics at the University of Chicago (BA'2015, Linguistics). My main academic interests surround the intersection of natural language and computer science.
