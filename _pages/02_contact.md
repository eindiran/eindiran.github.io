The best way to reach me is via [email](mailto:elliott.indiran@protonmail.com). Please don't send me spam.

I'm also on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eindiran), [GitHub](https://github.com/eindiran), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eindiran/). I am quite active on GitHub, so of the 3, you're most likely to catch me there. Still, 9/10 I would recommend you trying to email me before you go on some fool's errand trying to find me on <insert-social-media-site-here>.

If you are trying to contact Sitrus, reach me should be what you want. I managed the Sitrus [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/sitrus19), so once the platform launches that will be a potential avenue to reach me at.

If you would like to see a copy of my résumé, you can find the link [here](https://github.com/eindiran/resume). If you would like any clarification, don't hesitate to reach out.
