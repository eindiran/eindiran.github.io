I've been using [Xfce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce) as my desktop environment since college, shortly after I switched to Linux for my daily driver.
There are a pretty wide variety of desktop environments and window management solutions in Linuxland and Xfce struck the right balance for me on the spectrum of bare-bones to bloated: fairly minimal while still retaining usability.
Xfce is lightweight, but still a full desktop environment, with a window manager, a desktop manager, a settings panel and a graphical file manager.
A big plus for me at the time was that Xfce isn't really a keyboard-first environment (cf. [i3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I3_(window_manager)) or [awesome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awesome_(window_manager))), which meant that I didn't need to leave a mouse-based workflow while I was getting used to Linux in general.
Over the years, my workflow has gradually become more keyboard-centric (enough so that I've been considering a switch over to i3 or dwm, but that's a topic for another post), so I wanted to record the various Xfce-specific shortcuts I have used to enable that transition.



If you want to give Xfce a spin, you can download it [here](https://xfce.org/) or try a distro that comes with it like [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) or [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/get-manjaro/). It is available on some non-Linux *nix OSes (any *nix that can support [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System)), including the BSDs and macOS.
