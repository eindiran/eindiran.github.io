I've been on something of a kick for the past week, binging through the first three albums by _The Chameleons_, and it has been great.
Very few bands have released a 3-album run as good as _The Chameleons_ run during the mid eighties: 1983's _Script of the Bridge_, 1985's _What Does Anything Mean? Basically_, and 1986's _Strange Times_.

_The Chameleons_ never managed to find the pop-culture success or popularity of many of their post-punk contemporaries. Bands like _Joy Division_, _The Smiths_ and _The Cure_ penetrated the mainstream consciousness, achieving a name-brand recognition and persistent level of radio airplay that seemed out of the question for _The Chameleons_ for most of the intervening 3 decades.
But in the last 10 years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the band, largely fostered by online music communities giving several "cult" post-punk bands a chance to reach much larger audiences.
This led Blue Apple Records to remaster and re-release their albums between 2009 and 2012.

Last year, I decided to treat myself and purchased their remastered discography: I find myself coming back to it again and again, and it just seems to get better.

* [The Chameleons - Script of the Bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcEK6uTAezs&list=PLEA68302BA1F4217D) - This was my first _Chameleons_ album, so it will always hold a special place in my heart. If you've been exposed to other English post-punk bands, this will probably be the album with the most familiar sound in their discography. Favorite track: [Here Today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns9-PbXxApQ&list=PLWQjX6NZXSEA1doE_B169VrftaRqeLMVX)
* [The Chameleons - What Does Anything Mean? Basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIlEM0US71Q) - This album is a grower. I'd start with the other two, but don't think that means it doesn't pack a powerful punch. I wasn't sure about it on the first listen, but by the second, it had won me over. Favorite tracks: In Shreds
* [The Chameleons - Strange Times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ3osEyiiXU) - _Strange Times_ is, by quite a large margin, my favorite post-punk album. If you haven't heard of _The Chameleons_ (or any post-punk in general), I'd start here. Favorite Track: Soul in Isolation

Some other albums I've been listening to this week:

* [Deru - 1979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11JITPeYAWs) - A perfect piece of melancholy, tailored for a walk on a rainy fall evening. Favorite track: Pathologically Bored
* [Duster - Contemporary Movement](https://dusternumero.bandcamp.com/album/contemporary-movement) - Not _Duster's_ most famous or acclaimed album, but the first album where Jason Albertini was playing a full-role in song-writing. Unfortunately, this was also the last album before the band began an extended hiatus, lasting nearly 20 years. _Contemporary Movement_ manages to preserve the magic of _Stratosphere_, while remaining very much its own beast. Favorite track: Get The Dutch
* [High Command - Beyond the Wall of Desolation](https://highcommandsl.bandcamp.com/album/beyond-the-wall-of-desolation) - This album rules. Favorite track: Impaled Upon the Gates
