title:  "Is Forth homoiconic?"

This article came about because I was browsing the Wikipedia page for [homoiconicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity), and I noticed that [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) was not listed as a homoiconic language.
This immediately struck me as odd; my mental model of what homoiconicity _means_ suggests that Forth should definitely be considered homoiconic.
