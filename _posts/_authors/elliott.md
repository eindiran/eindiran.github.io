Elliott is a computational linguist and software engineer who has been working on speech recognition and living in the Bay Area for the past 3~4 years. He emjoys using to data to solve problems and gain insights about the world, particularly problems in his personal life. Perhaps because of this, he co-founded the [Sitrus QS Platform](https://sitrus.io) with friends from college. Sitrus is currently preparing for its initial launch, which should happen in December of 2018.

Prior to coming to the Bay Area, Elliott studied linguistics at the University of Chicago, where he received a BA in 2015. He misses it, but is very glad that San Francisco does _not_ have winters like Chicago.
