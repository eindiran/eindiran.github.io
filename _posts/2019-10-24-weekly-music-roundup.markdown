Lately I've been wanting to have some format I could use to force other people to listen to music I've been listening to, but short of becoming a popular music reviewer or starting a pirate radio station, I'm not sure how feasible that is.
So I've decidede to settle to doing a weekly roundup of what I've been listening to on here.
I don't think I'll be doing reviews as such, but I'm not sure how the format will evolve, or if I'll even be particularly faithful to keeping it up.

Without further ado, here is my weekly music roundup:

* [An Isolated Mind - I'm Losing Myself](https://anisolatedmind.bandcamp.com/album/im-losing-myself) - This is a very interesting album, which defies placement into traditional genre boxes, but if you enjoy metal I'd encourage you to give it a spin. Favorite track: 'Turritopsis dohrnii'
* [Floating Points - Crush](https://floatingpoints.bandcamp.com/album/crush) - Floating Points' latest album finds FP moving in a less conventional musical direction than his last few efforts (notably [Elaenia](https://floatingpoints.bandcamp.com/album/elaenia)), constructing a much colder and more sparse soundscape. At times uncomfortable and deconstructed but always beautiful. Resist comparisons to other IDM until a second listen. Favorite track: 'Requiem for CS70 and Strings'
* [Wire - Pink Flag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Wi94-JGrtc) - Wire's 1977 debut. I've been trying to learn more about the British punk scene, and this was a brilliant place to start. Favorite track: 'Three Girl Rhumba'
* [Maskull - Maskull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFSg8xpQN2w) - The album has been described as the ["gothest album of all time"](https://dangerousminds.net/comments/maskull_gothest_album_of_all_time). It's hard to argue with that description. The vocals sound like Robert Smith turned up to 11.
* [박혜진 park hye jin - I DON'T CARE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ8ysMzL2BE) - A random YouTube recommendation. Is K-House a thing? It is now apparently. Check out the whole EP (IF U WANT IT).

Something more on the light side of things: I stumbled onto this nu-disco artist through a commercial that was featured on an old episode of Norm MacDonald Live. If you like Empire of the Sun or Cherub, this might be in your wheelhouse.

* [Kennedy - Wanted the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NydLqY9R3zk)
* [Kennedy - K.E.N.N.E.D.Y.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJuyrvxBgjo)
* [Kennedy - Karate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exrLylxFGUk)
