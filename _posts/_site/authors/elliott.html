<p>Elliott is a computational linguist and software engineer who has been working on speech recognition and living in the Bay Area for the past 3~4 years. He emjoys using to data to solve problems and gain insights about the world, particularly problems in his personal life. Perhaps because of this, he co-founded the <a href="https://sitrus.io">Sitrus QS Platform</a> with friends from college. Sitrus is currently preparing for its initial launch, which should happen in December of 2018.</p>

<p>Prior to coming to the Bay Area, Elliott studied linguistics at the University of Chicago, where he received a BA in 2015. He misses it, but is very glad that San Francisco does <em>not</em> have winters like Chicago.</p>
